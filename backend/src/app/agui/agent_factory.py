"""Agent factory for Multi-Model Agent Registry (CTR-0026, CTR-0070, PRP-0035, PRP-0046).

Creates an AgentRegistry maintaining one Agent instance per configured
deployment name. All agents share the same Tools, Skills, MCP tools,
and context_providers. Only the underlying client differs.

Weather tools (CTR-0027, PRP-0017) are registered as AI functions.
Coding tools (CTR-0031, CTR-0032, PRP-0019) are conditionally registered.
Agent Skills (CTR-0043, PRP-0024) are conditionally loaded via SkillsProvider.
MCP tools (CTR-0060, PRP-0031) are dynamically loaded from config file.

PRP-0046 adds ``include_mcp`` / ``include_rag`` parameters so that DevUI,
which runs in a separate asyncio event loop on a daemon thread, can
construct an agent that does not share MCP tool async contexts or the
ChromaDB client with the main FastAPI loop.
